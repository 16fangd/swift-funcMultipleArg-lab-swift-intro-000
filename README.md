> I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Create functions that contain multiple arguments.
* Call on functions with multiple arguments.


## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Knows how to use the print function (although they might not know that it's referred to as a function at this point).
* Can create variables of type String and Int (no other types).
* They already completed a lab on functions (but not with multiple arguments)
* They will have just finished reading about functions which contain multiple arguments and this will be the first time they're tested on it.



## Outline / Notes

*  Not every question needs to have the student create functions with multiple arguments.
* We don't have to limit the number of arguments to two when asking them to create functions.
